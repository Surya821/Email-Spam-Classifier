# Email-Spam-Classifier
This project builds a spam email classifier using machine learning. It processes a dataset of messages labeled as "spam" or "ham", applies TF-IDF for feature extraction, and uses logistic regression for classification. The model predicts whether new messages are spam or legitimate based on learned patterns.
